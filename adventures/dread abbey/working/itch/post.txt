How might a 5e adventure be transformed into a draw steel adventure?
MacGraw Hideaway serves as one example to answer that question!
It's a 6-Victory adventure/quest for 1st level heroes and can be finished in a single night.

In the Tullow Vale of Vasloria, the MacGraw tribe of goblins terrorize the Baron's Road as it passes through the forest north of Ivywatch, plundering caravans and kidnapping merchants and travelers. The heroes arrive upon an ambushed caravan just as the tribe scurries away with their screaming haul into the forest. Can you save the good folk of Tullow Vale before they meet their end at the hands of the goblins and their cruel leader?

The adventure can lead right into Raiders of Ivywatch (still aiming for early October release on that). 
The map style, size, the formatting of the adventure, really everything about the adventure is very similar to Raiders. Sort of an appetizer!

Fully tested and ready to play! It's five bucks! I hope you enjoy if you check it out
