= Dread Abbey =
Death House adaptation, 4th level

* start with a vignette of each adventurer, "someone is looking at a pamphlet... who?"
	- just do the classic horror tropes, like Cabin in the Woods
		> pass out the character card - has lines of dialogue!
			* if you say a line at an appropriate moment, 
				** the retainer gains 1 temp stamina which stacks
				** the hero has a bane on their next power roll
			* if the retainer already has 5+ temp stam, each extra temp stamina
			  also grants the Director +1 Malice.
			* the house can use Malice out of combat!?
			* some lines are explicitly TRIGGERS of other lines!
		> if your character dies, they have a Free Triggered Action that lets them
		  haunt (help) the still-living heroes in a specific way! You cannot
		  do this if your hero is only inert and not dead.

* begin by protecting the retainer, horror when they get caught in traps, etc. 
	Lots of traps and other dynamic terrain objects!

* once the retainer dies, the genre shifts from horror to Doom-style Evil Dead
	- slaughter the undead hordes!
	- objective becomes much clearer, the floor gives out! We fall into the basement!
