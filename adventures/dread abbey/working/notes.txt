	** gore, blood in various places - all over, really

	** wildman throwing rocks at/through windows and disappearing into forest
	** paintings watching from the wall, paintings changing, smiling
	** odd, unknown religious idols in the chapels, crying blood - sacrificial table with small bones

Death of Bertrand:
1) ENCOUNTER 1: fight hordes of undead in the abbey, get to the center stone!

** bertrund explodes into a meat mass - slowly trudges toward the courtyard (cannot be killed)
** meat mass grows arms and a MAW and TEETH and CLAWS and TENDRIL, becomes a flesh dragon!

Bertrand Lives, or after Encounter 1:
2) ENCOUNTER 2: fight the Meat Dragon in the courtyard
	* thorn dragon
	* stone walls begin to turn to flesh!
	* river turns to blood!

3) 2nd MONTAGE TEST to escape the malicious abbey imploding on itself
	* wacky dimension folding bullshit
	* cause and effect muddled
	* flashbacks, ghosts, vignettes from the past that turn angry at the heroes

4) end with a great final read-out; whomever survived is forever changed, for the worse.
	* titles for each character archetype for continuing to play
