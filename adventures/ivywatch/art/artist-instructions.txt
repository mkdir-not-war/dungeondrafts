* want it to feel like the difference between cover art of old PC games and in-game art
* like the vibrant colors of "Horror Vision" - all interior art is B&W line art
	^ but would prefer something in the daytime
* really like the ornate border on "Glory Owl" and "Endless Graves, (something)"
	since the image is encompassed in a white page, maybe the border could be white?
* want to use Caudex font, if possible
* > send title card to include "raiders of... a 1st level..."
* > send background and synopsis of adventure
	* NOTE: the hawklords are basically medeival knights who ride giant hawks,
		and they attack cities by dropping boulders like bombs on buildings
* > send image of cover of against the cult of the reptile god
	* too "comic book cover" action movie-y. I want something more distinctly album cover-y
		maybe more gestault dream-like, less obviously a camera pointing at the action
* > send mockup
	* maybe we put "cover art by jaelani36" right on the art itself where "glory owl" is?

* image will be on the cover as shown in the mockup, and will be the title card for the crowdfunder - send link to The Great Thaw: https://crowdfundr.com/Gryzmithrak-Spire?ref=ab_5gK9zwA1iMg5gK9zwA1iMg
