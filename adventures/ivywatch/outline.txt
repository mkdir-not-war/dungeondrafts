== OVERVIEW ==
	1) The hawklords bombard the city and whisk away the sealing stone
		- town is named Ivywatch - sealing stone seals passage to Arcadia under city
	2) town is ravaged: local lizardfolk tribe sees opportunity and attacks!
		- steals citizens & occupies the city, bring hostages to moathouse
	>> ENTER THE HEROES
	3) phandalin opening: ambush on the road to ivywatch
	4.1) if the party investigates the tracks to the cave
		- phandalin cave dungeon, save the carter, learn about ivywatch
		- occupation of ivywatch is done when party arrives
	4.2) if the party continues to ivywatch
		- ivywatch is occupied, fight through the town
	5) enter the keep, lots of townsfolk taking refuge. Lord is barely keeping it together
		- lots of injured as well
		- hysterical young father begs you to save his wife
		- center of town: evidence of something very large & prominent now missing
	6) montage test to track lizardfolk to their hideout
		- super success: find side entrance to underground
		- success: find the fort occupied by its guard...
		- failure: find the fort empty, surprised by the guard returning
		** guard = Ogre Goon + Skitterling Minions
	7) a scout/squire of the wode elf knights enter from the portal to Arcadia! 
		the knights cannot leave Arcadia even if they wanted - their oath prevents it
		the squire hasn't taken the oath yet so they were sent to check on things...
		** the squire isn't actually interested in helping, they'd rather get back
		   to the knights ASAP and help fight against Arcadia. 
		   Lizardfolk aren't really a threat anyway...
		** can negotiate to convince them to help in various ways. Retainer?
	8) save the citizens before... some imminent threat! What are the lizardfolk up to???
		** summoning a naga god!
		   <<homebrew monster - aspect of naga>>
	9) return to ivywatch, but! Another squire and the townsfolk don't get along! 
		Squire is like the previous squire, but sent to check on the Sealing Stone,
		blames the villagers for not protecting it seriously enough!
		Mediate the parties, get reward and possibly a new verb/quest


What is the night stone equivalent??
	* The Sealing Stone - positioned in the center of 4 knight's forts to seal the 
		portals to the realm of evil fae - story says the knights
		entered the portals to take the fight to the enemy and activated the stone,
		essentially locking the door behind themselves in the fae realm...
	* Town is named Ivywatch
