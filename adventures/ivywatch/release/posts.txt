"Raiders of Ivywatch" a 1st-Level Draw Steel Adventure coming to Backerkit

In the Tullow Vale of Vasloria, a centuries old town is built around a weathered statue said to seal away an ancient evil. Ajax's Hawklords bombard and lay waste to the town, stealing the statue, and in the chaos, the pitiless Deatheye Yslansh and her lizardfolk minions abduct the citizens!

Can you save the people of Ivywatch before they are put to the Deatheyeâ€™s fell purpose?

And what or who exactly have the Hawklords unsealed?

The campaign goes live on May 27th. A preview of the adventure is available now!
