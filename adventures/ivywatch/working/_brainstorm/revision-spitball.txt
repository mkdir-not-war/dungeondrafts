what if the adventure was completely different??

1) Keep the Cave ~ or maybe not? Maybe we just take the lessons learned and reimplement elsewhere?
2) Hawklords still attack Ivywatch
3) Deatheye Yslansh summoning Excruicior Interfectus

==================================================

idea: something like castlevania season 3? Except that's too town-centric, maybe.
	I don't like making battlemaps in towns, I prefer caves and fortresses.
	...
	> town is raided
	> SOMETHING flees to safety near the town
	> it DOESNT LEAVE, and the people in the place it was last seen start acting weird

	1) get to town - fight demons
		* opener is at the town gates! not on the road
			^ baldurs gate 3 style? Save the people trapped outside the town?
	2) meet the town people and lord, learn about the orb and the watchtower
		* interrupted when demons attack! They're coming from the chapel!
	3.1) go to the chapel, there's a strange portal open on the orb... let's go in!
		* group-test to explore a weird evil, brutalist, concrete cathedral thing?
			floating above a sea of primordial goop
		* fight in the main hall, release the prisoners whose blood powers the orb!
		* montage to escape the collapsing cathedral!
		* while you were gone, knights from the watchtower placed strange totems around town,
		  and "arrested" two young children for "obstructing justice"!
	3.2) go to the watchtower and meet with a knight outside, very cordial. Mystery!
		^^ maybe can do the Meet In An Ambush theatre-like scenes in a room thing here?
		* hear screams inside the watchtower, knight pulls out a dagger, fight at the entrance!
	4) assault on the watchtower - goes underground!
		* small dungeon -> 
		  underground caves (montage test to find 1 of 2 entrances) ->
		  deep dark eldritch dungeon! Captured demon! Knight cultists!
		

idea: something that involves the politics of the region more? Or at least introduces them.

=================================================

Extra scenes nearby in Tullow Vale as a stretch goal?
	* can use the Cave here!
