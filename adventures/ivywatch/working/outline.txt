	* all statues throughout the fort have "<Name>, whose heart belonged to ______"
	* the vines on the maps coming through the walls are from arcadia,

==== HISTORY NOTES ====

	* Pages haven't swore their oath yet
	* when the order went into arcadia, they left the pages
		> caelia becomes an empire
		> caelian empire takes over the vale, no more king >> new town-and-lord system
		> everyone speaks caelian now
		> no more king = oaths are worthless(?), pages split up and evolve
		> thorned gauntlet pages become the hawklords, protecting the vale anyway
		> oakshields hunker down around the statue, forming ivywatch
	Page -> Squire -> Knight -> Paladin -> Commander (-> King)

	The Forestal witness

	As the oak gives shade and never wavers in a gale                        >> inscribed on Thorton's blade
	So will I shelter the Vale and never waver in the storm of evil

	(The Duty of Thorns)
	As thorns draw blood from those who covet the rose
	So will I draw blood from fiends who covet the Vale
