		- town is named Ivywatch - sealing stone seals passages to Arcadia in region
	2) Lizardfolk raid the town and kidnap citizens!

	>> ENTER THE HEROES

	*) Heroes arrive at the town!
		- a HORDE of lizardfolk pass the heroes, carrying villagers!
		- an evil lieutenant smiles wickedly, from the forest taunting the heroes,
			some villagers have already been taken! This is the last squad out!
		- protect Lewin Coppertoe and save the villagers!

What is the night stone equivalent??
	* The Sealing Stone - positioned in the center of 4 knight's forts to seal the 
		portals to the realm of evil fae - story says the knights
		entered the portals to take the fight to the enemy and activated the stone,
		essentially locking the door behind themselves in the fae realm...
	* Town is named Ivywatch
