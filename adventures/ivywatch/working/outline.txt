*** STRETCH GOAL IDEAS ***
1) An "Encounters" PDF with the respective monster stat blocks consolidated onto a single page 
	for each combat encounter in the adventure.
2) Once Raiders of Ivywatch is released, I'll begin work on a follow-up adventure set in Tullow Vale.

TODO: 
	* update Lewin profile art to include Baxter!
	* make Deatheye art (zoomed out, view of the forest army) for end of Scene 1.
	* final fight should be VERY HARD to do BOTH saving the people and preventing the ritual:
		- if the people are not saved, they turn into death knights! Nazgul! -> new adventure
		- if the ritual isn't stopped, the evil god turns into a character like
			HxH Meruem - maybe it possesses Yslansh! -> new adventure
	* tips on how to Level Up the adventure to 2 or 3.

	** Idea for Forest Clearing Scene 5:
		> find a small squad of lizardmen and citizens, all dead
		> fight with something really scary! Arrix?? Bredbeddle?? Lightbender??
							Fuck it! Make our own monster!
		> Hawklords swoop in for the final blow and fight the party after--
			looking through the corpses for the Jewel?

REMINDERS:
	* remember to plug crafting materials in the dungeon
	* remember to clearly signal danger upon entering dangerous rooms (for harlequins)

== TIME ==
	1) Fight at the gate [1-2] (lizardfolk leaving - extra: save the kidnapped villagers)
	2) Group test to deflect incoming bombardment on citizens [1]
		>> raise the tension with the townsfolk
	3) Hawklords come down and attempt to steal a child (they have the thing) [1-2]
		(extra: save the child)
		>> learn about the B Plot - hold onto the Jewel of Redemption
		>> Gain Jewel of Redemption magic item & Hope of Ivywatch title

	*) skill/group tests at ivywatch keep
	*) montage test to find dungeon [1]
	4) entrance fight [1] (ogre/lizardfolk)
	5) prayer hall fight [1] (twilight princess from arcadia)
	*) portal room with squire, potential negotiation [0-1]
	6) ziggurat boss fight [1-2] (1: save the villagers, 2: prevent the summoning)
	*) montage test to leave [1]

	optional 1) other entrance [1] (ogre/lizardfolk)
	optional 2) tomb/lab [1-2] (lizardfolk - extra: save the squire before they kill him)
	optional 3) magic sword [1] (undead guard the sword)
	optional *) hall of statues
	optional 4) knights quarters/kitchen [1-2] (lizardfolk - extra: save the children)

	Victories: [8-18]
	Hours: 2*combats + 1*others = [16-25]

***** Fighting the summoner = Goxomoc encounter
	> if you fail! Instantly teleported to Arcadia - denouement is licking your wounds,
		you must now find the knights and convince them to help you against
		the newly summoned demon! 
	> if you succeed, MONTAGE TEST to escape the crumbling fortress and save the citizens!

== NOTES ==

	ARCADIAN KNIGHTS (Knights of Golden Ivy):
		1) Andreja - protect lives, serve (Motivation: Protection)
			Order: The Oak Shields
			Charge (design on shield): Seven-Pointed Star, Gold on Green
			"â€˜Tis to glory we steer, for the lives of all.
			  To honour we answer, our hearts and our blades,
			  As one, we call."
		  ** Squire Gwalchmai (first wode elf)
			> Motivations: Higher Authority, Protection
			> begins Suspicious (Interest 2, Patience 2)
			> Pitfalls: Revelry, Freedom
				doesn't fight just for the glory or fun of it
				doesn't *want* to go home, belongs on the battlefield
		2) Derioc- fight in glory, might (Motivation: Revelry)
		3) Grigor - avenge the fallen in the war, duty (Motivation: Vengeance)
		4) Nicklaus - end the war so we can go home, begrudging (Motivation: Freedom)

		some statues (A & B) have oaths written on them, the rest are illegible
		>> obelisk room has oaths B & C

		A: Andreja
		B: Derioc
		C: Grigor
		D: Nicklaus

		** Whichever fort portal found first, do that encounter with the wode elf
		** Whicever for portal found second, lizardfolk reinforcements!
		** If the party become pages of the knights, they have tattooed rings on their
		   fingers that track their courage - they must push back the forces of arcadia!
		   ^^ knights greet eachother by showing their hand (ring finger)
		2) Fort Portal:
			- some statues have oaths written (A & C & D). If all oaths are read,
			  in order, the portal opens to Arcadia! (A>B>C>D)


== OVERVIEW ==
	1) The hawklords bombard the city and whisk away the sealing stone
		- town is named Ivywatch - sealing stone seals passages to Arcadia in region
	2) Lizardfolk raid the town and kidnap citizens!

	>> ENTER THE HEROES

	*) Heroes arrive at the town!
		- a HORDE of lizardfolk pass the heroes, carrying villagers!
		- an evil lieutenant smiles wickedly, from the forest taunting the heroes,
			some villagers have already been taken! This is the last squad out!
		- protect Lewin Coppertoe and save the villagers!	
		- to Ivywatch Town Square (1) or Follow the Horde (2)
	*) Ivywatch Town Square
		- The Sealing Stone is missing!
		- Fight a returning Hawklord, accuses the party of commanding the lizardfolk!
		- meet the Lord of Ivywatch and the citizens
		- stakes go up! how? someone was kidnapped who is needed to protect the city?
	*) montage to find the dungeon
	*) the dungeon!
		- 4 session max, I think (~10 scenes max, ~6 combats at most)

== PLOTTING ==

	* The heroes are escorting Coppertoe for 1) payment and 2) political connections
	* Coppertoe has a dog that belongs to his cousin, the steward
	* fight lizardfolk on their way out - they're taking the hobbits to isengard
	* meet deatheye yslansh, ooo she's so evil!
		- if the lizardfolk encounter is before the dog,
		  the players have tension: they want to chase the lizards too!
		- if the lizardfolk encounter is after the dog runs in,
		  how do we meet the deatheye? 
	= players want to chase lizardfolk
		* skip to montage test - result is the heroes find straggling lizardfolk in the forest
		* fight the stragglers
		* arrive at the ogre
	
	* hawklords drop rocks and head toward the keep,
		one rock is dropped on the remaining enemies in combat! also hits hero!
	* dog runs off toward the keep!
	= players want to chase the dog

	* chase the dog through the city with a montage test!
	* arrive at the keep - success: as the hawklords arrive, failure: after the hawklords
	* fight the late hawklord and demons from the orb, the guards help!
	= players dont like the hawklords now

	* guards say the lord will reward them
	* meet the lord and coppertoe's cousin
	* [use old adventure stuff here]

	* montage test to track the lizards to fort ranaghan


What is the night stone equivalent??
	* The Sealing Stone - positioned in the center of 4 knight's forts to seal the 
		portals to the realm of evil fae - story says the knights
		entered the portals to take the fight to the enemy and activated the stone,
		essentially locking the door behind themselves in the fae realm...
	* Town is named Ivywatch
