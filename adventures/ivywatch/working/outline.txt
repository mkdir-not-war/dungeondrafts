	* some crafting materials throughout?

==== HISTORY NOTES ====

	* Pages haven't swore their oath yet
	* when the order went into arcadia, they left the pages
		> caelia becomes an empire
		> caelian empire takes over the vale, no more king >> new town-and-lord system
		> everyone speaks caelian now
		> no more king = oaths are worthless(?), pages split up and evolve
		> thorned gauntlet pages become the hawklords, protecting the vale anyway
		> oakshields hunker down around the statue, forming ivywatch
	Page -> Squire -> Knight -> Paladin -> Commander (-> King)
		

==== KNIGHTS OATH ====

	(The Prayer) ------- do not speak this except when swearing your oath the first time
	The Forestal witness
	You uplifted us				> dweric
	Orden shivered
	Witness me

	(The Duty of Oak) ---------- generally begin your oath here
	As the oak gives shade and never wavers in a gale                        >> inscribed on Thorton's blade
	So will I shelter the Vale and never waver in the storm of evil

	(The Duty of Thorns)
	As thorns draw blood from those who covet the rose
	So will I draw blood from fiends who covet the Vale

	(The Offering)
	My blood belongs to the King
	My heart belongs to my ______
	My mind is focused on the mission
	
	(The Promise)
	I will speak no lies
	I will fear no evil
	I will protect the Vale

	(The Ultimatum)
	Until the three-jawed usurper lay dead, or do I
