==== KNIGHTS OATH ====

	(The Prayer)
	The Forestal witness
	You uplifted us				> dweric
	Orden shivered
	Witness me

	(The Duty of Oak)
	As the oak gives shade and never wavers in a gale
	So will I shelter the Vale and never waver in the storm of evil

	(The Duty of Thorns)
	As thorns draw blood from those who covet the rose
	So will I draw blood from fiends who covet the Vale

	(The Offering)
	My blood belongs to the company
	My heart belongs to my ______
	My mind is focused on the mission
	
	(The Oath)
	I will speak no lies
	I will fear no evil
	I will protect the Vale

	(The Ultimatum)
	Until the three-jawed usurper lay dead, or do I
