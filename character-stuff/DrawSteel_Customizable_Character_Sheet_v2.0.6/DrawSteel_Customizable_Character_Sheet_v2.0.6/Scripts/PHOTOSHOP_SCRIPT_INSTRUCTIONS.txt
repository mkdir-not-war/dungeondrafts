PHOTOSHOP TEXT LAYER EXPORT/IMPORT SCRIPTS
============================================

OVERVIEW
--------
These scripts allow you to export all text layers from Photoshop documents to a CSV file for translation, then import the translated text back into your documents.

REQUIRED FILES
--------------
- ExportTextLayers.jsx (Export script)
- ImportTextLayers.jsx (Import script)

HOW TO USE
----------

STEP 1: EXPORT TEXT LAYERS (Optional, do if you don't have the file with the original terms used in the Character Sheet)
--------------------------
1. Open your Photoshop document(s) that contain text layers
2. In Photoshop, go to File > Scripts > Browse...
3. Navigate to and select "ExportTextLayers.jsx"
4. Click "Open" to run the script
5. Choose where to save your CSV file (e.g., "text_export.csv")
6. The script will create a CSV with two columns:  (See example of file format in ORIGINAL_TEXT_FILE.csv)
   - OriginalText: The text from your layers
   - TranslatedText: Empty column for you to fill in

STEP 2: TRANSLATE THE TEXT
--------------------------
1. Open the exported CSV file in Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor
2. Fill in the "TranslatedText" column with your translations
3. Save the file (keep the same format)

STEP 3: IMPORT TRANSLATED TEXT
------------------------------
1. Make sure your original Photoshop document(s) are still open
2. In Photoshop, go to File > Scripts > Browse...
3. Navigate to and select "ImportTextLayers.jsx"
4. Click "Open" to run the script
5. Select your translated CSV file (See example of file format in EXAMPLE_IMPORT_TEXT_FILE.csv)
6. The script will automatically replace all matching text in your documents

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
- The scripts work with ALL open documents at once
- Only unique text content is exported (duplicates are ignored)
- Text matching is based on content, not layer names or IDs
- The scripts handle text in both regular layers and layer groups
- Make sure to keep your original documents open when importing

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If no translations are applied, check that your CSV has the correct format
- Make sure the "TranslatedText" column has actual content (not empty)
- Verify that the text in your Photoshop layers exactly matches the "OriginalText" column
- The scripts are case-sensitive, so "Hello" and "hello" are treated as different

CSV FORMAT EXAMPLE
------------------
OriginalText,TranslatedText
"Hello World","Hola Mundo"
"Welcome","Bienvenido"
"Click here","Haz clic aqu√≠"

That's it! Your text layers should now be translated in your Photoshop documents.
