	- idk if they do non-anthro art
	- not a lot of armor that looks authentic to anything ever, basically vibes
	- $310 [full body] + 35 [armor detail fee?] + 40 [additional chars] = 385
	- does not do fully custom painted backgrounds, but will do royalty-free stock with painting over
	- CANNOT USE COMMERCIALLY - but lots of RPG art? Maybe we can ask?
		* kind of out of my price range for not-a-sure thing

https://scissorsrunner.carrd.co/#prices - super cheap and really dope!
	^^ won't let me use commercially! Sadgeeeeeee

------------------------ no commercial ^^^

------------------------ not sure

	- AGGRESSIVELY cheap, allows commercial use, looks great
		* fullbody = 65 + 20(3) [extra chars] + 10 [background] = 135 * 1.1 [commercial] = $148.50
	- timeline might be long for big projects?
	- maybe I should reach out soon!
	- maybe this artist isn't as good as I think they are?

------------------------ not sure ^^^

------------------------ good, but... 

@yellowsyro.bsky.social
	- crazy good art, would love to get them
	- not doing commissions right now, but also no links

	- I know her! Gondramos!
	- not expensive
	- no art of motion/action... idk if she has the chops I want!
	questions:
		1) can I use commercial?
		2) are you taking big commissions? full page?
		3) want some epic motion, mid fight, I see a lot of portraits and intimate moments, but
			do you have some work that shows movement? Are you comfortable with that?

		bonus) work in the future: share art plan for kiln
		bonus) do you do layout, or know someone who does?

------------------------ good, but ^^^
