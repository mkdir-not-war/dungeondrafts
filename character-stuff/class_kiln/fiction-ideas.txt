The main line of the Kiln is
"I have just the thing"

Once they understand the problem, they know the solution. They have a hundred, a thousand solutions.
The difficulty always just lies in _fully_ understanding the problem.


IDEA:

1) a fight breaks out, the kiln arrives and does a flashy thing to resolve it - uses talisman
2) "this changes nothing" there's a bigger problem at hand that two characters are arguing about
	in a way that obfuscates the details. Not intentionally. Just cuz they know it in-and-out.
3) The Kiln asks more direct questions, trying to get to the heart of the issue
4) finally the Kiln asks "so at the root of the issue is:" and summarizes the core of the problem
5) the friends, exasperated, say yes, essentially
6) the kiln holds up a different talisman "I have just the thing"

 Kevin ran with James for their lives. The four-armed creature was gaining on them and laughed. Maybe it just enjoyed the chase.
 The path curved around a corner and terminated in a tall black stone wall laced in a netting of some odd plant. "A dead end!" Kevin called out to James and cringed at his own choice of words. They both turned to face the creature's approach, but to their surprise as it burst into a pyre. Red flame turned to blue, then white, then gold, and the creature turned to ash.
 "Halt!" a voice shouted from their own minds as another man-shaped creature floated down from the canopy of giant fungi. It stowed some small wooden tablets in a pack hidden behind its huge moth-like wings and wiped ash from its claws onto its legs. Two bulbous, multi-facted eyes glimmered in the grey, filtered light from the clouds above. Though the face had personable features, it lacked a mouth. And yet, the voice still came.
 "We are Curtis." The creature reached out to the webbing of strange plants. "Yes, the Undermind orders us to this place, but for what. For you two? To kill the invader and save you? But why? Speak."
