====== LAYOUT ========

1) 1-page setting primer for Inner Earth
2) Soulborn Ancestry
3) Spellbinder Class
	* the Soulbinder, Soulsmoker, Soulburner, Soulflare, Soulcinder, Soulspark
	* the Woodwill, the Cinder

======= TO DO ========

* lean more into forced movement options
* what does this class do well?
	DPS	Mob	Heal	Stam	Stick	Comm	Buff	Debuff	Control
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Low	Med	Low	Med	Med	Low	High	High	High
							^^^^	^^^^	^^^^
	** fury is low healing, despite temporary stamina, so we are low healing too
	** conduit is low dps despite a couple hard hitting 5-HR abilities, so we are too

* We should feel a lot more like we're risking it all when getting in close,
	if our buffs run out (not entirely in our control, bit of risk!), we
	could potentially have landed ourself in a very bad situation.

* Rethink subclasses, and possibly rethink Depth as a heroic resource.
	Maybe Talismans are our resource? Rather than always having the three?
* Burning a talisman should not only buff us but also create some kind of unique
	risk factor. We should be thinking not only "which of these is perfect for this fight"
	but also "which of these is a risk that I can manage in this fight?". 
	> Not a simple debuff, but something you *want* to ride the line of. For example, 
	maybe one grants 1d3 Depth when you end your turn adjacent a foe, 
	but if you hit 6 Depth, you Drown in a unique way to that talisman?
	> Then we can play with Drowning in subclasses?

===========

SUBCLASSES: Hexdrinker (mistborn), Witch Hunter (witcher), Cryptokinetic (alucard)

= summaries =
** all subclasses have buff/debuff/control
* Flameweaver (mistborn): mobility/dps (harrier)
* Hexblaze (witcher): self-heal/dps (fury-like, risk/reward, doom playstyle)
* Smokewight (alucard/nautilus): mobility/stick/temp-stam (engage tank, lock down, intercept)


*** need respite stuff - at the end of each respite...

Wicker Man - force move an enemy into the center of a 3x3 DTO, then they're restrained.
	while they're restrained, you can control the wicker man as a retainer!
	Or just free maneuvers on your turn *like* it's a retainer

Cataclysm - your epic resource!

Ashbound & Infernal Totem - 
	* choose an ally, make a talisman of them. Choose one of their
	  signature abilities.
	>> going to have to rework this >>
		** while talisman is not flared, can use the signature ability yourself.
		   If the ability can trigger one of the ally's triggered actions, they
		   can use that triggered action on the ability for free.
		** when you flare the talisman, you cannot use the signature anymore.
		   The ally gains 3 Heroic Resource and until EoE, they gain all your
		   flared talisman passive bonuses.
