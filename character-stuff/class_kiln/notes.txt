======= TO DO ========

** high level Smokewight: all pulls -> vertical pulls!

* lean more into forced movement options
* what does this class do well?
	DPS	Mob	Heal	Stam	Stick	Comm	Buff	Debuff	Control
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Low	Med	Low	Med	Med	Low	High	High	High
							^^^^	^^^^	^^^^
	** fury is low healing, despite temporary stamina, so we are low healing too
	** conduit is low dps despite a couple hard hitting 5-HR abilities, so we are too

===========

SUBCLASSES: Hexdrinker (mistborn), Witch Hunter (witcher), Cryptokinetic (alucard)

= summaries =
** all subclasses have buff/debuff/control
* Flameweaver (mistborn): mobility/dps (harrier)
* Hexblaze (witcher): self-heal/dps (fury-like, risk/reward, doom playstyle)
* Smokewight (alucard/nautilus): mobility/stick/temp-stam (engage tank, lock down, intercept)


*** need respite stuff - at the end of each respite...

Wicker Man - force move an enemy into the center of a 3x3 DTO, then they're restrained.
	while they're restrained, you can control the wicker man as a retainer!
	Or just free maneuvers on your turn *like* it's a retainer

Cataclysm - your epic resource!

Ashbound & Infernal Totem - 
	* choose an ally, make a talisman of them. Choose one of their
	  signature abilities.
	>> going to have to rework this >>
		** while talisman is not flared, can use the signature ability yourself.
		   If the ability can trigger one of the ally's triggered actions, they
		   can use that triggered action on the ability for free.
		** when you flare the talisman, you cannot use the signature anymore.
		   The ally gains 3 Heroic Resource and until EoE, they gain all your
		   flared talisman passive bonuses.
