=== WHAT IS THIS CLASS? ===

* You perform RITUALS during combat. You have your own set of victory conditions.
* Sometimes, you need to adapt your Ritual, switching halfway through as the conditions of the battle change!

>> maybe instead of amassing Heroic Resource, or instead of Heroic Abilities costing HR, 
	your heroic abilities can be used FREELY **within** overlapping completed rituals!!

* think:
	> Exodia!
	> drawing the magic circle -> what does it do? change the battle completely!
	> bad guy draws alchemical circle under city in FMAB
	> collecting orbs to power up vs raid boss in Destiny

==== CHALLENGES =====

* how do Victories give you a headstart on your shit?
* how do we prevent the map from getting overloaded with a fuck ton of little AoEs to track?
