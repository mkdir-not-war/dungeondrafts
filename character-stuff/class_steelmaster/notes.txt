I'm thinking maybe it could be a mixture of what it is now and Strain from the Talent: you can either 
1) spend heroic resource to use a heroic ability like all other classes do, and 
2) get an additional beneficial effect on the ability if you have a specific stance unlocked when you use it, and finally 
3) use the ability for free (or at a discount) if you have ALL its required stances unlocked when you use it

I also think the mobility of the class is pretty front loaded right now into the clear path trigger. 
I think it could be spread between that, a maneuver, and maybe some Level 2 subclass features.

==== MAJOR IDEA ======

* abilities have a 1) base form 2) variation form 3) second variation form
	> you have a number of combos based on your school that follow variations
		e.g. 	Base -> Wrath -> Fool
			Base -> Plow -> Wrath
	> when you finish a combo, something cool happens

* Stances:
	Serpent, Boar, Ox, Hawk, Window, Long, Fool, Crown, Short

Serpent
Boar
Hawk
Ox

Long
Short

Window
Fool
Wrath

Crown


	> standard stance: (based on school)
	> 

** instead of heroic abilities, you have combos
** use 1 heroic resource per stance on your turn -> if you finish a combo, you do the combo ender
	> opportunities to do multiple actions? How do you dump HR?


======= TO DO ========

* lean into forced movement options
* what does this class do well?
	DPS	Mob	Heal	Stam	Stick	Comm	Buff	Debuff	Control
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	High	High	Low	Med	High	Low	Low	Low	Low
	^^^^	^^^^			^^^^	
	** fury is low healing, despite temporary stamina, so we are low healing too
	** conduit is low dps despite a couple hard hitting 5-HR abilities, so we are too
