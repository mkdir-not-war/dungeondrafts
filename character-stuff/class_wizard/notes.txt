==== MAJOR IDEA ======

* using limited words (subclasses grant lexicons), create your own abilities
	> can only use a word once in your spellbook, never repeat a word
	> more words = higher HR cost of the ability
		or maybe, higher HR = use *more* of your spells!
		maybe the spells have Effect1, Effect2, etc and your HR spent unlocks each effect
	> complexity is ok, this is THE complexity class!

======= TO DO ========

* lean into forced movement options
* what does this class do well?
	DPS	Mob	Heal	Stam	Stick	Comm	Buff	Debuff	Control
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Low	Med	Low	Med	Med	Low	High	High	High
							^^^^	^^^^	^^^^
	** fury is low healing, despite temporary stamina, so we are low healing too
	** conduit is low dps despite a couple hard hitting 5-HR abilities, so we are too


===========

SUBCLASSES: 

* lightning subclass: mobility, debuff
* sound subclass: debuff, command
