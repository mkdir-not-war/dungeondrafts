=== RULES ===
* first word determines the power roll effects
* subsequent words modify the effects, in order of words
	> effects involving target location care only about when the mod is applied, e.g.
	"adjacent targets" must be adjacent after any previous effects/mods that force-moved them.
	> assignment effects are snapshots, e.g. "temp stamina = rolled damage" sets temp stamina
	to rolled damage when the mod applies, not the final rolled damage after all mods apply
* mods with "[order]" are [weak] as the 1st mod, [average] as the 2nd mod, and [strong] as the
	3rd mod and beyond.
* keywords, targets, and distance are all equal to the final word
* ability names are ADJ+...+NOUN
* HR = (words-1)*2-1, min zero.
