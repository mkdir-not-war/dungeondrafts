"This section here translates to... desert, thirst, and blood."
"Properly ominous for a tomb."
"A lot of writing from this period is pretty dire. This part depicts Nitokret-"
"the Scourge"
"-Nitokret the Scourge, being entombed here and then... rising again? No... thieves? Pretenders? Her children come and dress up as her? That can't be right..."
"What about this part down here? It looks just like the beginning. The same armor, the same sword, the skull on the face. Riding the giant winged serpent, razing a city to the ground. Scourge stuff. But you said the writing reads-"
"-top down, aye. So Nitokret is dead by that point. But... Ah, I see. The Scourge isn't an epithet. It's a position. The tools made the craftsman."
"But the tomb is raided. The 'tools' aren't here."
"Aye."
"If you're right... and the Scourge of Khemhara isn't here in this tomb anymore," the treasure hunter looked up, posing the first question of the day to which they weren't excited to find an answer. "Then where exactly is it?"
"I suppose," the scholar looked down and shrugged, "wherever blood slakes the sands."
