1st: Covert Ops
While in your presence or working according to your plans, 
each of your allies gains an edge on tests with any skill 
from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can use the 
Lead skill to assist on any test made with a skill from the 
intrigue skill group. At the Directorâ€™s discretion, you and 
your allies can use skills from the intrigue skill group to 
attempt research or reconnaissance during a negotiation 
instead of outside of negotiation

"I want to choose my arrow effect not in town, and not after the power roll, but when I attack."
	- no risk element, just reading the situation. A skill ceiling! Learning the arrows!
		** should have both actions and maneuvers, and order matters, like stormwight
		** phase changes like stormwight? Maybe
		** prefer casting magic or rune carving to oil/ointment/salve
		** tactical benefit to using weapons and using ranged weapons specifically

Keywords: Magic, Ranged Type: Triggered
Distance: Ranged 5 Target: 1 ally

ability after seeing the result of the attack. 
Effect: The attack gains an edge and deals holy damage 
equal to twice your Intuition score.

IDEA:
	3 kits to choose from, each one has 3 effects.
	Triggered action is like Holy Infusion, but you can pick one of the 3 effects
	Can sacrifice one of the effects - cant use it anymore for triggered actions, but 
		it powers you up in a specific way
