===== IDEA =====

* city in Vanigar at the mouth of a huge pit - made in the abyss-like.
* no one knows how deep the pit goes, but it's very warm, unlike the surrounding region
* the city is the Gate to... Hell Vanigar. They call it something.
	The city's name is... Hell Vanigar Gate? Oxrest? Something descriptive and historic.
